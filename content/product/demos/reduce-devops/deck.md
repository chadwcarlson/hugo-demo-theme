  Disclaimer: This one reads like the black and white portion of an infomercial
  Script
    Overlay: Reduce the amount of overhead needed to spin up the infrastructure for a new project
    Split screen showing scrolling through files:
    DIY Platform
    Terraform file showing config for AWS application server, plus configs for db server and cache server
    Ansible configs for each of these servers
    Platform.sh
    Highlight config sections in services.yaml matching Terraform configs
    Highlight config sections in .platform.app.yaml matching Ansible configs
    Split screen with sped-up videos:
    DIY Platform
    Show terminal running Terraform and its output
    Show terminal running Ansible and its output
    Platform.sh
    Show `git push` and its output
    Begin both videos at real-time speed showing the commands being entered and the first bit of output, with a timer at the bottom center of the screen.
    Flash something like 3x speed on the screen and speed up the video.
    After the `git push` finishes deploying, overlay the total completion time over that side, flash something like 5x speed, and speed up the DIY solution as it continues its output.
  Shows
    Higher efficiency
    Faster time to market (literally)
    CAPEX to OPEX (kinda)
    Reduce DevOps
    Automatic provisioning (kinda)
    Automatically resolve dependencies
    Build code on git push
    YAML-based config
